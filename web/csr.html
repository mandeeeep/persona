<h3>CSR</h3>
<p>CSR is a project management application developed using Java Web/JSP. It was basically developed for the use of the organization (internship) itself. It covers most of the functionalities required by the organization like handling the projects details, and its contacts and also provides user level restrictions. The interesting features in the application are the automated Gantt chart generating modules. Though it’s still in its developmental phase it is still usable, as is being used by the organization at the time of speaking. It’s an application used only inside the firm, and wasn’t created as a product, for the time being.</p>
